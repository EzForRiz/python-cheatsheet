# This code shows how 'for' and 'while' loops work â€” 'for' loops repeat a fixed number of times, while 'while' loops run until a condition is false.


#  The 'range()' function controls loop counts and direction (range(5, 0, -1) counts backward), and indentation defines which lines belong to the loop.
