#lists are similar to arrays in python but more flexible

# This code uses 'for' loops to go through each element in a list — one by one — and store it in a loop variable (like 'fruit' or 'item').


# Inside the loop, the 'print()' statement runs for every list item, letting you display or use each value individually.
